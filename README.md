 # Web API & NLP
 
---

### Problem Statement:
The United States possesses over 312 million internet users who produce the vast majority of the content consumed by the entire 4.93 billion people that have access to the web. This, in partnership with the United States' existing and elevated position on world interests, represents an evolving and potentially vulnerable domain. 

Allowing and displaying open access to American political discourse is, in turn, having a direct impact on international news, discussion, and the contextual understanding of the U.S. position is within the worldwide web. As the internet continues to evolve, how will online discussions within the United States shape the evolving sentiments and ideas of the international community? In particular, what topics in US discourse carry the most influence 
on the global political discussion?

### Executive Summary:
The featured project was focused on integrating three important data science concepts into the production of a professional, meaningful, and intuitive analysis. These concepts were 1) Advanced Data Acquisition 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 3) Classification Modeling. Each of these was conducted in partnership with Scikit-Learn and the Natural Language Tool Kit libraries among others.

Made noticeable by the project and the work it encouraged was the depth at which advanced models approach data and evaluate provided data. This highlights the significance of every aspect of the data science process. By developing and using a variety of analytical approaches, the potential for data-driven solutions becomes massive. 

### Selected Data for Analysis:
The following project utilized data pulled from the featured subreddits:

**/r/politics** <br>[U.S. News/Political Disucssion](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/)<br>
News and discussion about U.S. politics (7.8 million members).


**/r/worldnews** <br> [International News/Political Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/)<br>
News and discussion about international political interests (27.2 million members).

### Conclusions & Recommendations

#### Choice Production Model:
Of the supervised classification models that were studied, Random Forest produced the most optimal metrics. Random Forest algorithms are consistently accurate in relation to other non-linear classifiers. Slower processing time does not challenge its ability to address the problem statement.

#### Conclusions & Recommendations
Multiple conclusions were made after the analysis and classification modeling. The primary being that the sphere of influence of the United States and its activities is significant and made more so by the vast control American users display on existing online communities. Specifically, discussions of U.S. domestic volatility carry added interest of international agencies. Current events of this kind directly influence discussions abroad and greater international affairs. 

Having identified this key influence, it is recommended that further studies place greater focus on the influence of online discussions on the United States' position within the worldwide web. With access to larger amounts of data, classifications can more accurately predict evolving sentiment towards the U.S. both domestically and abroad.
